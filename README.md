# SMT 5 Save Editor 

Source Code coming soon. (as soon as I remove the AES keys and add library submodules properly)

Supports:
- No decryption required!
- General Player Info
- Player Stats
- Player Items (not including relics)

# Instructions
1. Open the nro
2. Select a region if it prompts you to. (We have to load saves from one or another and I detected that you have both).
2. Select a save file.
3. Make your changes
4. Press `+` to apply your changes
6. Play your hacked game
